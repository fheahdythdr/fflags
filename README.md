# rco-fflags
fflag configurations i use with my rco fork

to use them, simply go to C:\RCO2, create a file called custom_url.txt

from there, go to one of the folders in this repo, go to their ClientAppSettings.json, click raw, then copy the url into custom_url.txt, ex. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fheahdythdr/rco-fflags/main/FFlag%20and%20FPS%20Unlock/ClientAppSettings.json

got no idea why my old main got added as a contributor, but i guess it's here now

commit amount is very inaccurate, it seems to like just commiting randomly despite nothing changing
